print 1 + 4 # print o~~utputs the result of the code after the word print
print 3 / 1.8 # / means divide (dividing by a whole number is strange - more about that later ...)
print 2 ** 8 # ** is the "power of" operation
print 3 * "spam" # do you think this should work?
print 3 > 2 # evaluate the truth of this statement -> returns True or False
#print 2 * 3 + # if you remove the # at the beginning and run it, you will get an error, fix it so it prints out 10

## Exercises:

# Version 1: Calculate (and print out) 50 degrees of Fahrenheit as Celcius (32 F  = 0 C, 1.8 F = 1 C)
#print ??? # instead of ??? put in the math to convert 50 Fahrenheit to Celcius and remove # at the beginning

# Version 2: F -> C conversion as above but now use variables as placeholders instead of numbers directly
F = 50 # makes F have the value to the right of the =
#C = ??? # your math from above but use F instead of 50. Once it works, use a different number for F (current temp?)
#print F, "Degrees Fahrenheit  = ", C, "Degrees Celcius"

# Version 3: will ask the user for F 
#F = float(raw_input("Enter Degrees Fahrenheit: ")) # will get the value of F from the console, type in number and hit Enter
#C = ??? # same as in Version 2
#print F, "Degrees Fahrenheit  = ", C, "Degrees Celcius"
