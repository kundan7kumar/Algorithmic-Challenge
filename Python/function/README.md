## Lambda Function


## Lambda with Map

map() is a higher-order built-in function 
that takes a function and iterable as inputs, 
and returns an iterator that applies the function to each 
element of the iterable.

## Lambda with Filter

filter() is a higher-order built-in function that takes a function 
and iterable as inputs and returns an iterator with the elements from 
the iterable for which the function returns True.
