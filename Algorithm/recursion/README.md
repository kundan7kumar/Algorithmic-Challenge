## Recursion


## When we can use recursion

Does problem divide in sub problem
could the problem be solved with arbitrary number of nested for loops?
Does the problem fit in recursive patterns?
Easier to solve it recursively than iteratively


## Basic Approach

Find the base case
Use the specific small examples
think about the return type

Find the recursive Step
The subproblem should be of the same form as the original problem
Do the recursive steps converge to the base case?

## Return Types
 Can print the result
● 3 ways to return results recursively
○ Store results to a global variable
○ Store results to a passed variable
○ Build up the results as we return
